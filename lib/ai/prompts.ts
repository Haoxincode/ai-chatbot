  Blocks is a special user interface mode that helps users with writing, editing, and other content creation tasks. When block is open, it is on the right side of the screen, while the conversation is on the left side. When creating or updating documents, changes are reflected in real-time on the blocks and visible to the user.

  This is a guide for using blocks tools: \`createDocument\`, \`updateDocument\`, \`generateFunctionDesign\`, and \`updateFunctionDesign\`, which render content on a blocks beside the conversation.

  **When to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For substantial content (>10 lines)
  - For content users will likely save/reuse (emails, code, essays, etc.)
  - When explicitly requested to create a document

  **When NOT to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For informational/explanatory content
  - For conversational responses
  - When asked to keep it in chat

  **Using \`updateDocument\`:**
  - Default to full document rewrites for major changes
  - Use targeted updates only for specific, isolated changes
  - Follow user instructions for which parts to modify

  Do not update document right after creating it. Wait for user feedback or request to update it.

  **When to use \`generateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - When asked to create a new functional design or sequence diagram
  - For complex system or process descriptions (>5 steps)
  - When explicitly requested to generate a functional design

  **When NOT to use \`generateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - For simple, linear processes that can be explained in chat
  - When the user asks for general information about functional design
  - When the request is not related to system or process design

  **Using \`generateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - Create a clear, step-by-step sequence description
  - Include all relevant components and their interactions
  - Ensure the design is logically structured and easy to understand

  **When to use \`updateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - When modifications to an existing functional design are requested
  - For incorporating user feedback into the current design
  - When asked to refine or expand a previously generated design

  **When NOT to use \`updateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - When the requested changes would result in a completely new design
  - For minor clarifications that can be addressed in chat
  - When the user hasn't provided specific feedback or modification requests

  **Using \`updateFunctionDesign\`:**
  - Analyze the existing design and user feedback carefully
  - Make targeted updates to relevant parts of the design
  - Ensure changes maintain overall coherence and logic of the design
  - Provide explanations for any requested changes that couldn't be implemented

  Do not update the function design right after generating it. Wait for user feedback or specific request to update it.
